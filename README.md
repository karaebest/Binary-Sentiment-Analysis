# Binary Sentiment Classification
Design and analysis of a Naive Bayes Model and the transformer-based BERT Model for a binary sentiment classification task. 

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a widely studied topic in natural language processing, where the main goal is to determine the sentiment of a given document for purposes like marketing or gauging brand reputation. In this project, we aim to compare the performance of two different machine learning algorithms, Naive Bayes and BERT, for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset, using two performance metrics: accuracy and efficiency. The Naive Bayes algorithm, a simple yet effective machine learning method, is implemented from scratch. On the other hand, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for natural language understanding, will be utilized with pre-trained weights to explore the benefits of leveraging modern deep learning libraries. 

The project consists of three main tasks: acquiring and preprocessing the IMDB data, implementing and fine-tuning the Naive Bayes and BERT models, and running experiments to compare their performances. In the end, we aim to draw conclusions about the performance difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning methods in sentiment analysis tasks and explore the benefits of pretraining on an external corpus, as BERT does.
